# 🎨 Rotating Ball Animation in Java

## 📌 Description
This is a simple Java Swing application that displays a **rotating blue ball** in a black background. The animation starts and stops using two buttons: **Start** and **Stop**.

## 🛠 Features
- 🔵 Smooth ball rotation animation
- 🎛 Simple GUI with Start and Stop buttons
- 🖥 Uses **Swing** and **AWT** for GUI rendering
- ⏳ Timer-based animation control

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash

```

### 2️⃣ Compile & Run the Code
```bash

  java Main        # Run
```

## 📜 How It Works
- The GUI consists of a **JFrame** with a JPanel for rendering.
- The ball rotates around a fixed center using **Graphics2D transformations**.
- A **Swing Timer** controls the rotation by updating the angle every **10 milliseconds**.
- Two buttons allow starting and stopping the rotation.
